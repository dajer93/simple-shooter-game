## Simple shooter game
This is a hobby project of mine to create a really simple Space Invaders like game in P5.js. The challenge in this project was to make all of the magic happen with webpack. This way I could separate the modules of the game: Enemy, Bullet, Player, etc.

### Scripts

- `yarn start` - start the webpack development server
- `yarn build` - make a production build
